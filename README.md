FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

(c) 2014-2015 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

============================================

This fork features:

- "Clear non-copper" feature, supporting multi-tool work.
- Groups in Project view.
- Pan view by dragging in visualizer window with pressed MMB.
- Basic visualizer performance tricks.

Plans for the far future:

- OpenGL-based visualizer.
